This repository contains the set of codes corresponding to my problem set. 
- Exo 3 was done using the JAX library. The performance will be optimal if you run it on Colab while activating the GPU
- Exo 4 was done using Statsmodels and Scikit-learn
- Exo 5 was done using Scikit-learn. All models are tuned using GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV and the final out of sample R2 are reported.
