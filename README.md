# Metrics Part II - Homework 1

This repository contains the set of codes corresponding to my problem set. 
- Exo 3 was done using the JAX library. The performance will be optimal if you run it on Colab while activating the GPU. Then, it runs completely (including the 1000 repetitions for all Wald and confidence intervals) in 5 minutes, which is the maximum performance I could reach.
- Exo 4 was done using Statsmodels and Scikit-learn
- Exo 5 was done using Scikit-learn. All models are tuned using GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV and the final out of sample R2 are reported. To run it on Colab, you simply need to upload the data on the Colab environment.
